## ‚ùó Problem Statement
Economic inequality concentrates wealth and resources among a minority, limiting opportunities for the majority and fostering **economic stagnation**, **social unrest**, and **political instability**.

---

- Rising costs of goods and essentials (including healthcare) disproportionately impact low and middle-class families.
- Limited access to quality education and job opportunities perpetuates poverty cycles.
- **Social mobility** in the U.S. has stagnated compared to other countries.
- Addressing disparities is crucial for building a **fairer, more sustainable** economic system.

- Often leads to **job polarization**, where middle-skill jobs decline.

### Legislation and Policy
