Definition
- Economic inequality is the unequal distribution of income and wealth among a
society’s population
- There are a variety of measures for economic inequality
- Income Inequality: Differences in earnings (wages, salaries, investments)
- Wealth Inequality: Disparities in assets (Property, stocks, savings

  Problem Statement
Economic inequality concentrates wealth and resources among a minority,
limiting opportunities for the majority and fostering economic stagnation,
social unrest, and political instability of a society.

Importance
- There is a growing economic disparity in the United States. The larger the gap widens the more
difficult it becomes for the lower and middle class to accumulate wealth
- Rising costs of goods and essentials disproportionately impact low and middle class families,
including healthcare. Limited access to quality education and job opportunities perpetuate cycles of
poverty
- Social mobility has stagnated in the US in comparison to other countries
- Addressing the disparities is essential to creating a fairer, more sustainable economic system

 Key Takeaways
- Wars and disasters:
- Major wars and economic crises initially reduce inequality through government spending, job creation,
and increased wages, but post-crisis recoveries often benefit the wealthy more, widening disparities
- Technological advancement
- Technological growth can create wealth for the tech sector and the wealthiest individuals but often
leads to job polarization
- Legislation and Policy
- Policies like the New Deal and the GI Bill helped reduce inequality through social programs, education
access, and labor rights. Conversely, tax cuts and deregulation disproportionately benefited the
wealthy, increasing inequality
- Globalization and Outsourcing
- Globalization and outsourcing of jobs in manufacturing industries led to the decline of blue-collar work

Current State of economic Inequality
- What is the Gini Coefficient?
- The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of economic inequality, ranging from 0 to 100
- A Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality (everyone has exactly the same income)
- A Gini coefficient of 100 represents perfect inequality (one person has all the income, everyone
else has zero)
- How is it measured?
- calculated using the Lorenz curve, which plots:
- The cumulative percentage of the population (from poorest to richest) on the x-axis
- The cumulative percentage of income on the y-axis
- The Gini coefficient is the area between: The actual income distribution (Lorenz curve) and the
line of perfect equality (45-degree line)


Current State Cont.
- 0
- Perfect equality
- <= 30
- Considered threshold
for normal coefficient
- Wealth is distributed
normally
- >=40
- Considered high value
- Large gap between the
rich and the poor
- Wealth class divide
- 100
- 1 person holds all the
wealth

Current State of Equality - Wealth Distribution
- Top 0.1% average: $63,232 per person
- Next 0.9% average: $8,700 per person
- Next 9% average: $1,896 per person
- Middle 40% average: $360 per person
- Bottom 50% average: $23 per person
  
- Top 0.1%: 330,000 people
- Next 0.9%: 2,970,000 people
- Next 9%: 29,700,000 people
- Middle 40%: 132,000,000 people
- Bottom 50%: 165,000,000 people
  
- A person in the top 0.1% has 2,728x more
wealth than a person in the bottom 50%
- Extreme wealth divide as the top 10% hold
over 60% of the wealth
- Top 0.1% holds 5.5x more wealth than entire
bottom 50% combined

Factors Contributing to Economic Inequality
- Education level
- Does a higher Education level affect one’s economic standing
- How does education level give people access to different resources as other education levels
 Importance and Benefits of Higher Education
- Better pay, better job security, career advancement opportunities
- Enable saving and investments with money, allow to build wealth over time
- More knowledge about healthcare leading to a healthier lifestyle and access to medical
insurance and services
- More access to better housing in safer neighborhoods
- Well-educated societies experience more innovation, productivity, and overall growth → leading
to reduced inequality over time

Factors - Job Displacement
- Job Displacement = when workers lose their jobs due to economic changes like technological
advancements, automation, globalization, or shifts in industry demand/needs
- Without a job people are in much different places and have to take action
- Commuters to School → Chain reaction of events such as difficulty going to school to further education
- Many displaced workers move into lower-paying jobs, while high-skilled workers in thriving sectors
   command higher wages, increasing the income gap → increasing inequality
Relationship between Economic Inequality and Job Displacement
- Economic inequality creates vulnerabilities (e.g., fewer savings, less access to education) that make job
displacement more devastating
- Widespread job displacement leads to economic changes that concentrate wealth and resources
among fewer individuals, intensifying inequality.

Factors - Tax Policies
- Tax Policies
- A progressive Tax Policy is where higher earners are taxed more compared to lower earners
- Alter incentives to earn, save, and spend
- Influence ease of access to resources and services
